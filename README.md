# DiscordNight

Requires [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) desktop app with [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) addon installed.

After installing BetterDiscord:
1. Download [**DiscordNight.theme.css**](DiscordNight.theme.css) and navigate to **Settings > Themes** and click on **Open Theme Folder** or place the file in **%appdata%/BetterDiscord/themes**
2. Refresh Discord using **CTRL+R** or restart Discord.
3. Go to **Settings > BetterDiscord > Themes** and enable **DiscordNight**.

Make sure you have **Dark Theme** enabled in Settings > Appearance > Theme and select Dark  
      Having **BetterDiscord Blue** enabled is recommended but not necessary for the theme to work correctly for the most part.  
      BetterDiscord Blue is enabled in Settings > BetterDiscord Core > BetterDiscord Blue.  

Keep in mind that things may break at any time because of Discords background updates which may cause you to have to reinstall BetterDiscord or wait for the theme to be updated.

## Installing DiscordNight using other methods
- If you don't want to use BetterDiscord or it does not work for some reason the CSS can be injected using Discords developer tools using **Ctrl+Shift+I** in the Desktop app or F12 in the browser. In the **Sources** tab go click on **assets** and find the file that ends with **.css** and paste in the code from **DiscordNight.css** into it, if done correctly the theme should be loaded until the next time Discord restarts (Keep in mind that images loaded from an external address will not load this way).

## Installing DiscordNight to your internet browser
- By using a stylesheet addon like Stylus, you can create a style for **discordapp.com** and paste in the code from **DiscordNight.css** (Not everything will work correctly like scrollbars and external image)
